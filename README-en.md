# SaFan
### Overview

SaFan is a browser project based on Python. This is my first project, developed with the assistance of DeepSeek AI (it seems everything is done by DeepSeek AI). Currently, this project is still unfinished and I look forward to everyone's participation in modifying and perfecting it. (Actually, SaFan is derived from the word Sofa.)
### A Few More Points
- Based on Python (very unfinished ðŸ˜­)
- It's lacking in many features. If you happen to see this, I truly hope you can help improve this project.
### Installation Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- A Python environment installed (version 3.x or above is recommended)
### Running Methods
1. First, download all the source code of this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the source code is located.
3. Run the command `python main.py` (or simply `main.py`) to start the SaFan browser.
You might wonder why it's so hard. The reason is that I don't know how to package it yet.
### How Can I Contribute?
If you're interested in this project, you are welcome to contribute to its improvement:
1. Modify the existing code to fix potential issues.
2. Add new features to the project.
